## What is this project?
This is a real-time collaborative drawing board, supporting multiple users to draw on the same boards at the same time.  
It has near infinite boards, and they are always saved to the database.  
The drawing boards can be used to quickly draw up something with your friends or co-workers. 
## Technologies Used
- Used TypeScript, React and Next.js for the code
- Hosted in Vercel, used Vercel Analytics, Firewall and Deployments
- Used WebSockets to connect users (Pusher)
- Saved data in Supabase in PostgreSQL format
- Styled the app with Tailwind
## How to use
Use the link at the beginning of this text. When you are at the page, you will have the option to create a new board, or join an existing one with a 8-digit code.  
When you are at the drawing board, you can use features like pencil, colors or eraser to create whatever you like.
